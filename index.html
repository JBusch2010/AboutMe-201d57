      <h2><u>A little about me</u></h2>

      <p>As you should know now, my name is Joachen! I love to play video games, eat gummy bears, watching anime, and I also enjoy drinking, mostly whiskey/bourbon!</p>
      <p>I've been serving in the Army Reserve for a little over 8 years now and each year has made me love it and hate it more each day, before this my civilian job was Help Desk Rep for a pharaceutical company named, Regeneron.</p>
